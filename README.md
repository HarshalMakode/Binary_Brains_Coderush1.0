## Quick Start 🚀

This project requires Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.  Follow the installation instructions below to get started.


## Installation ⚙️

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
*   A MongoDB instance (for the backend)
*   A Cloudinary account (for image/file storage)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rajat12826/Binary_Brains_Coderush1.0.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Binary_Brains_Coderush1.0/Front
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    ```

5.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6. **Set environment variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB URI, Cloudinary credentials, and Session Secret.  Example:

    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
    ```

7. **(Optional) Configure Clerk.js:** Obtain a publishable key from Clerk.js and add it to your `.env` file in the `Front` directory as `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.


## Usage 💡

**Frontend:**  Start the frontend development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode.

**Backend:** Start the backend server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the backend server in development mode.  You'll likely need to have your MongoDB and Cloudinary configured correctly for this to function properly.
